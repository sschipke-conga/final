## Summary
  This project was built as a 48 hour tech challenge using, Vue; a new framework for me at the time. User's can see the current month's photos from the NASA APOD API (updated every day). The user starts on the current day's photo and can then see all the photos for the month and select one of them for a more detailed view.
